25. Can we override static method in Dart?

-->  No, you cannot override static methods in Dart. Static methods in Dart belong to the class itself,
not to instances of the class, and they are not part of the inheritance hierarchy. Therefore,
they cannot be overridden by subclasses.

    --> Static methods are associated with the class itself and are invoked on the class,
      not on instances of the class. Subclasses can define their own static methods with
      the same name as a static method in the superclass, but this is called "shadowing" rather
      than "overriding." When you call a static method, Dart will use the method defined in
      the class where it is called, without considering inheritance.
