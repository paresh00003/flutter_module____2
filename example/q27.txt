27. Can a class implement more than one interface? B10. Can a class
extend more than one class in Dart?

--> Yes, a class in Dart can implement more than one interface. Dart supports multiple interface inheritance,
allowing a class to declare that it implements multiple interfaces by listing them separated by
commas in the class declaration. This enables a class to inherit and provide implementations for
multiple sets of behaviors defined in different interfaces.

--> No, in Dart, a class cannot extend more than one class. Dart uses single inheritance for classes,
which means a class can only have one superclass (base class). This design choice was made to avoid
the complexities and ambiguities that can arise with multiple inheritance, such as the "diamond problem."
However, Dart allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, which provides a form of multiple
inheritance for interfaces.
