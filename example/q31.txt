31. What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with
same identifier?

--> If both the parent and the child class have a field with the same identifier in Dart,
the child class field will hide (or shadow) the parent class field. This means that when you access
the field in an instance of the child class, you will be working with the child class's field,
not the parent class's field. The parent class's field will be effectively hidden within
the scope of the child class

B16. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to
sub_classes?

-->  Constructors and initializers are not inherited by default in Dart.
Each class, including subclasses, must define its own constructors. However,
Dart provides a way to call the constructor of the superclass using the super
keyword in the subclass constructor. This allows you to reuse the initialization
logic of the superclass constructor in the subclass constructor.
