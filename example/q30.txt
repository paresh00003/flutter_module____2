30. Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of
the super class?

-->
In Dart, you can pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the superclass.
Dart supports polymorphism, which means that a reference to a subclass can be treated as a reference
to its superclass. This allows you to pass a subclass object to a method that expects a superclass
object, and the method will work with it as long as the subclass inherits from the superclass.


B14. Are static members inherited to sub_classes?

In Dart, static members (static fields and static methods) are not inherited by subclasses.
They are associated with the class in which they are defined and cannot be accessed through
subclass instances or subclass names.
