. How do you implement multiple inheritance in Dart?

--> Dart does not support multiple inheritance in the traditional sense,
where a class can inherit from multiple classes. Dart uses a single inheritance model,
where a class can inherit from one superclass only. This design choice was made to avoid
the complexity and ambiguity associated with multiple inheritance.
