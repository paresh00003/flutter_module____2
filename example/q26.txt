26. Can we overload static method in Dart?

--> No, you cannot overload static methods in Dart. Method overloading is a feature in some programming
languages where you can define multiple methods with the same name in the same class but
with different parameter lists. The appropriate method to call is determined based on
the number or types of arguments provided during the method invocation.

-->However, in Dart, method overloading is not supported, whether the methods are static or instance methods.
Dart does not consider the number or types of arguments when determining which method to call.
If you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, regardless of their parameter lists,
the Dart compiler will treat them as a single method with that name. Therefore,
the last method definition with the same name will effectively overwrite any previous definitions.
