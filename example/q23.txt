23 . Difference between inheritance and encapsulation.
B5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.

-->  Encapsulation is a mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates whereas

Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class acquires the properties and methods of another classe

purpose :

encapsulation hide internal data

inheritance help to reusebility

abstraction vs inheritance :

--> abstraction necessary data shown and un-necessary data hide

purpose:

Abstraction aims to simplify complex systems by identifying the core attributes
and behaviors that are relevant for a particular use case.
It hides unnecessary details.

inheritance help to reusebility
