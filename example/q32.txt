32. How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting by its sub_classes?

-->   you can restrict a member (field or method) of a class from being inherited by
its subclasses by using the final or const modifier on the member. By marking a member as final or
const, you prevent it from being overridden or modified in subclasses.
