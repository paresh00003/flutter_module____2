34. Can a class extend by itself in Dart?

--> No, a class cannot extend itself in Dart, or in most object-oriented programming languages.
Inheritance is a relationship between different classes, where a subclass extends or inherits
from a superclass. A class cannot be its own superclass or subclass. Attempting to create a
circular inheritance hierarchy where a class extends itself would lead to a logical contradiction
and is not allowed.
