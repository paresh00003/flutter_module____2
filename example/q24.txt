24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism

--> a) inheritance define in dart of process of which one class derive the property and
      characteristics of another class it's called inheritance.

      It is helpful as it provides an ability with which we can create
      a new class from an existing class.

      -> polymorphism means same object having a different state and behaviour.

--> b) 	Inheritance supports the concept of reusability and reduces code length.

      -> Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement
      at compile-time (overloading) as well as run-time (overriding).

--> c) Inheritance can be single, hybrid, multiple, hierarchical and multilevel inheritance.

    ->Whereas it can be compiled-time polymorphism (overload) as well as
    run-time polymorphism (overriding).
