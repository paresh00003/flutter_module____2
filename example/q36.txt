36. When to overload a method in Dart and when to override it ?

-->Method overloading refers to the practice of defining multiple methods in a class with
the same name but different parameter lists. These methods may have different numbers or
types of parameters. Dart does not support method overloading

--> Method overriding occurs in dart when a child class tries to override the parent classâ€™s method.
When a child class extends a parent class, it gets full access to the methods of the parent class
and thus it overrides the methods of the parent class. It is achieved by re-defining the same method
present in the parent class.
