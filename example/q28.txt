28. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?

-->  No, in Dart, an interface cannot extend more than one interface directly.
Dart supports single inheritance for interfaces, which means an interface can extend
(inherit from) at most one other interface. This design choice simplifies the language
and helps avoid the complexities that can arise with multiple inheritance in interfaces.
