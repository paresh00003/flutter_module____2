35. How do you override a private method in Dart?

-->In Dart, you cannot directly override a private method from a superclass in a subclass.
Private methods in Dart are denoted by an underscore _ prefix, and they are not visible outside
the library where they are defined. Since private methods are not accessible from outside the library,
you cannot override them in a subclass located in a different library.
