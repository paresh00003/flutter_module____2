38. How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final
modifier?

-->
In Dart, you can prevent a method from being overridden without using the final modifier
by using the @override annotation in the superclass. By adding the @override annotation
to a method in the superclass, you indicate that this method should not be overridden by any subclass.
If a subclass attempts to override a method marked with @override, it will result in a compile-time
error.
